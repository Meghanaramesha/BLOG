💡 Super Cool Event in "Twisted Tangle" by Rollic Games 💡 Just came across a brilliant event mechanic in "Twisted Tangle"! 🎉 Here’s the twist: the points or XP you earn to progress through event rewards are based on the seconds left on the timer when you complete each level. ⏱️ So, the faster you finish, the more points you get! 🚀This approach is fantastic, especially for puzzle games with timed challenges. It’s skill-based, so it feels super satisfying for players who master each level. Plus, from a monetization perspective, it’s genius! Players are motivated to beat levels quickly, which could lead to increased booster usage—and when those boosters run out, maybe even some purchases. 🛒What do you think of this timing-based reward system?
