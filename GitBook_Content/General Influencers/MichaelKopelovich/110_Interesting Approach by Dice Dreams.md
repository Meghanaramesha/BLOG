### [Interesting Approach by Dice Dreams](https://www.gamigion.com/interesting-approach-by-dice-dreams/)

Cool to see Dice Dreams featuring its celebrity collab directly on the App Store page. Having a well-known face in ASO can help with credibility and conversion. Not something you see often, but definitely an interesting approach. Have you noticed other games using this strategy?
