### [Welcome Back Pass designed for returning users on Survivor.io](https://www.gamigion.com/welcome-back-pass-designed-for-returning-users-on-survivor-io/)

🔑 Spotted something new in Survivor.io (Habby) — a Welcome Back Pass designed for returning users. Most games lean on:🎁 Welcome back gifts (a simple bundle)🎯 Welcome back events (less common — e.g., MONOPOLY GO! has one)But this is the first time I’ve seen a special pass created just for reactivated players.Why it’s clever:✅ Adds structure & progression instead of a one-off reward✅ Encourages players to re-engage daily after coming back✅ Opens monetization opportunities (premium pass upsell)It’s a fresh twist on reactivation design — turning “welcome back” into an ongoing journey rather than a single moment.👉 Curious — do you think more games will shift from gifts → events & passes for returning users?
