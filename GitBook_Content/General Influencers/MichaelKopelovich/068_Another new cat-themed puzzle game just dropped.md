🐾 Another new cat-themed puzzle game just dropped — Cat Bakery by Superbox! I’m seeing more of these recently, and this one stands out with a really clean and polished experience. Particularly liked this “Skip Ad” ticket UI — super clear, no friction, and blends nicely with the theme.Highly recommend checking it out if you're into sort games or just love well-executed UI.🧁🐱
