The “Booflix” screen is a great example of how visual design can elevate a common mechanic. The full-screen layout, animated ghost theme, and strong color contrast make it feel like a natural part of the game world — not just another ad screen.Why I like it:✅ Strong visual identity that fits perfectly with the game’s theme✅ Rewards tied to diamonds, a scarce and valuable currency✅ Clear progression bar that keeps players motivated to complete itA solid reminder that good design and reward framing can make even familiar features feel fresh and meaningful.
