### [Capybara Go! x Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!](https://www.gamigion.com/capybara-go-x-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/)

Another big crossover in mobile gaming — this time Capybara Go! teamed up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtlesfor a special multi-phase event.Phase 2 brings a mix of:🎰 TMNT-themed gacha raids🎟️ An event pass with free & premium rewards⚔️ Boss battles featuring Krang🎁 Daily logins & tasks tied into the collabWhat I really like here is that it’s not just a cosmetic skin drop — the IP is deeply woven into the event loops, progression, and monetization design.
