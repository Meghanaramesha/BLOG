If your game doesn’t have fun core gameplay, stop reading this. (No system can rescue boring gameplay)Let me guess:You’ve got decent gameplay.Cool graphics.A few rewards here and there.But players are leaving. Why?Because you’re NOT thinking about systems.Retention doesn’t happen by accident.It’s BUILT.Your players don’t stay for shiny features.They stay because they feel something:• A sense of growth.• A bond with friends.• The thrill of a challenge.Build systems around what keeps players.Here’s how:1. Progression↳ Make players feel like every session moves them forward.2. Competition↳ Design moments where they WANT to beat the person next to them.3. Emotion↳ Give them a reason to care beyond stats and wins.Stop blaming retention on external factors.Retention is YOUR responsibility.
