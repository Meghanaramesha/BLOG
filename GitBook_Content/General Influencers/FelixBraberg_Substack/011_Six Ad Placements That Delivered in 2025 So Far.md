Happy Q3, everyone! As it’s now mid-July and we’re more than halfway through 2025, it’s a great time to reflect on the ad placements that have been converting well in the first half of this year. Hopefully, anyone reading this will be able to try some of these placements and derive value from them for the remainder of the year.

1. **Step Offer Chain**

Tired of the same old “limited-time offer” banners in your game? Here’s a better way.

Try this sequence: *Free → Free → Rewarded Ad → Paid Offer → Free → Free*

Here’s why it works:

* The first two gifts serve as a gentle introduction, encouraging users to engage with the offer flow.
* The rewarded ad creates a low-friction monetization touchpoint and primes users for value exchange.
* The IAP offer lands right after that, now bundled mentally with everything before and after it.
* The two gifts after the IAP make the purchase feel even more valuable, like it's unlocking a bigger chain.

This structure seamlessly integrates user psychology, value stacking, and ad monetization into a single, elegant flow.

2. **Recency Effect Optimization**

If you haven't watched our Screw Master 3D episode with Supersonic, you're missing out. It’s packed with insights on how to maximize both IAP and IAA monetization. One key takeaway: Ad networks often rely on the recency effect, the idea that early impressions are more valuable because users are most attentive at the start of a session. This built-in logic helps maintain a high long-tail LTV, especially in high IMP per DAU games.

The clever trick Supersonic shared? On first app open, they cache ads and log the eCPM. Then, whenever they call a rewarded ad, they check if its eCPM is higher than the cached interstitial eCPM, and serve whichever performs better. Simple and ingenious.

3. **Convert or Die Rewarded Interstitial Placement**

The name sounds aggressive, but the results speak for themselves.

This placement works best during natural breaks in gameplay, like after completing a level. Typically, this is when you offer a rewarded ad to boost the player’s rewards or show a standard interstitial. So why not combine the two?

Here is the setup: first, show the player the option to watch a rewarded ad. If they decline and tap past it, immediately follow up with an interstitial. Simple.

Over time, users start to recognize the pattern. An ad is coming either way. Given the choice, many will opt for the rewarded ad because at least they get something in return. It is a subtle conditioning loop that drives higher engagement and better yields.

Subscribe or die placement :)

4. **Rewarded Ad Placement When You Leave the Store**

The in-game store has traditionally been the go-to location for rewarded ad placements. However, over time, this placement can lose its effectiveness, becoming buried under a pile of offers and bundles.

Playsimple found a better way. Instead of showing the rewarded ad inside the store, they trigger it after the user leaves, but only if no purchase was made. A full-screen pop-up appears once the user exits, offering a precise and distraction-free moment to engage with the ad.

This slight shift removes the cognitive load and consistently improves conversion rates by presenting the offer at a clean, high-attention moment.

5. **Skins & Paint Schemes Behind Stacked Rewarded Ads**

Players love customization. Whether it is mobile games or AAA titles, giving users the ability to personalize their characters and environments is a strong driver of engagement.

Skins are top performers when it comes to in-app purchases. But as always, only a small slice of your user base will ever spend money.

Tripledot offers a clever workaround in their hypercasual hit Color Maze. They gate specific skins and paint schemes behind a stack of rewarded ads. For example, users might need to watch three or five rewarded videos to unlock a cosmetic item.

This setup turns customization into a goal and nudges non-paying users into higher ad engagement without adding friction.

6. **Meta Rewards for Stacked Impressions**

One core truth of mobile games is that your audience is not one-size-fits-all. Some users love watching rewarded ads while others barely engage. So why not encourage the high watchers to watch even more?

Subway Surfers is a great example. The game offers meta rewards based on the total number of rewarded ads a player has seen. The more ads they watch, the better the perks they unlock.

This approach is also common in idle arcade games. For instance, watching 10 rewarded ads might increase your character's movement speed or boost how many items they can carry. Once that milestone is hit, you can unlock a new one at 15 ads and so on.

By turning ad engagement into a progression system, you make watching ads feel more like part of the gameplay and less like a chore.

In case you missed it… Knitting is cool again.

*Knit Out* by Rollic has been quietly scaling since March, now generating around $72k per day with a 30-70 split between ads and in-app purchases. It is another clear example of a puzzle-style hit from a former hypercasual studio that has fully transitioned into the casual space.

This is part of a broader trend: studios evolving from hyper to hybrid to entirely casual and relying more on IAPs than ever before. Want the full breakdown of how Rollic is doing it? Check out our latest episode.
