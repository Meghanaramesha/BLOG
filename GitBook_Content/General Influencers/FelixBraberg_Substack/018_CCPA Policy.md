**About this California Privacy Notice**

This California Privacy Notice is an important part of Substack’s [Privacy Policy](https://substack.com/privacy). While the framework used here is based in the provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), we provide the rights described here to all our users. If you are a California resident, please note that the processing of certain personal data about you may be subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and other applicable California state privacy laws. Any capitalized terms not defined in this California Privacy Notice have the same meaning given to them in our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and/or the CCPA.

## [**Your Privacy Rights**](#your-privacy-rights)

**Individual Rights**

The CCPA provides California consumers with several individual rights with respect to Personal Information. Note that these rights apply to individual consumers, not to companies. This section describes those rights in detail and provides information on how to exercise them.

**Exercising Your Rights**

To exercise any of the rights described in this section, please contact us at privacy@substackinc.com with (i) a complete description of your request, including the specific right(s) you wish to exercise and (ii) sufficient information about you so we can confirm that your request is a verifiable customer request, including at a minimum your name and email address. Once we have received your verifiable consumer request, we will respond consistent with applicable law.

You may also make a request by mail by sending the information specified above to:

Substack CCPA Requests

Please note that you may also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order for us to process a request from your authorized agent, we must (i) confirm that the agent is a natural person or business entity registered with the Secretary of State that you have authorized to act on your behalf, (ii) receive from you a copy of the written authorization that provides the authorized agent to act on your behalf, and (iii) verify your identity by asking you to provide us sufficient information in order to do so.
