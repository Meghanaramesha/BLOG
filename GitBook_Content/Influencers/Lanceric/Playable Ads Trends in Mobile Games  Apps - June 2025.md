As the UA landscape evolves, so do the creative trends that shape how games communicate with their audiences. With the rise of Applovin and increased spend on SDK networks, Iâ€™ve decided to bring youÂ **a monthly trends review**Â of top-performingÂ **playable ads**Â across different genres.

For those that read only summaries, here are playable trends June in a nutshell:

* Matching Madness or Anxiety Madness?
  + The world of match-3 playables seems to have hit peak anxiety. But there are some serious contenders with a fresh twist.
* Word Jam â€“ Association Puzzle: Emojis Done Right.
  + When it comes to word association games, **Word Jam** is proving that sometimes adding a little visual difference can go a long way.
* Temu â€“ The E-commerce Giant Showing the Way for Playables
  + While playables have long been dominated by gaming apps, **Temu** is proving that interactive ads can work wonders beyond gaming.
* Playable that made us play â€“ My Baby Unicorn â€“ Pony Care
  + I know itâ€™s for young audience â€“ but playable with pooping unicorn on the toilet? Yes please!
* Data from PlayableMaker â€“ whatâ€™s being created?

## Matching Madness or Anxiety Madness?

The world of match-3 playables seems to have hit peak anxiety. Everywhere I look â€“ whether itâ€™s **Royal Kingdom**, **Fishdom**, **Match Villains**, or **Matchington Mansion**â€“ itâ€™s the same story: your favorite characters are in distress, and only your matching skills can save them. The pressure is relentless. These games are pushing a frantic narrative that leaves my own anxiety levels spiking just from watching the playables.

Letâ€™s break it down:

### The Anxiety Formula

The premise is simple, and it works â€“ at least in terms of engagement. The narrative usually goes something like this, as you all probably know:

* Someone is trapped, drowning or freezing.
* Youâ€™re the hero, but you can only save them by solving match-3 puzzles.
* And, of course, the timer is ticking.

Every single creative follows the same high-stakes â€œsave them or failâ€ storyline. As much as itâ€™s not innovative, itâ€™s still very effective.

Why does this formula persist?

* **Itâ€™s Emotional**: These ads tap into primal emotions â€“ fear, urgency, and guilt. Who wouldnâ€™t want to save a drowning puppy?
* **Itâ€™s Addictive**: The high-pressure scenarios create a sense of mission. You *have* to download the game to see what happens next.
* **It Converts**: The formula has proven itself time and time again, so why reinvent the wheel?

But after seeing the same narrative recycled so many times, itâ€™s starting to feel tired. Worse, itâ€™s becoming overwhelming.

### A Refreshing Take: My Lovely Planet

Enter **My Lovely Planet**, which feels like a breath of fresh air amidst the chaos. You donâ€™t save anyone but you actually plant real trees, like for real. Your progress is rewarded by physical tree being planted on our planet. Letâ€™s see if in the creatives they will stick to their positive philosophy or go with the trendâ€¦

## Word Jam â€“ Association Puzzle: Emojis Done Right

When it comes to word association games, **Word Jam** is proving that sometimes, adding a little visual flair can go a long way. Their use of emojis in playables elevates the gaming experience, making it not only more engaging but also more memorable. In a genre that often leans heavily on plain text and minimal visuals, this creative decision is a standout factor.

### Why Emojis Work for Word Jam

**Emotional Connection**: Emojis evoke emotions and make the game feel more personal. A smiley face or heart resonates far more than a single word ever could.

**Instant Recognition**: Emojis are universal. They convey meaning instantly and eliminate the need for lengthy explanations.

**Engagement Boost**: Matching emojis feels more interactive and fun, especially when compared to plain text. It adds a layer of visual appeal that keeps players hooked.

### Why This Stands Out in the Genre

Word association games are often text-heavy and can feel repetitive. By integrating emojis, **Word Jam** manages to:

* Create a fresh aesthetic that sets it apart from competitors.
* Break the monotony of plain text visuals.
* Appeal to a broader, younger audience that is accustomed to emoji-heavy communication.



## Temu â€“ The E-commerce Giant Showing the Way for Playables

While some of the gaming companies still hesitate to use playables, **Temu** is proving that interactive ads can work wonders beyond gaming. Their approach? A mix of **simple puzzles**, **interactive end cards**, and **shopping simulations** that mimic browsing and adding items to a cart. Itâ€™s a masterstroke in engaging users and grabbing their attention. And as everything with Temu, all of them end with a big bonus, discount or â€œfreeâ€ gift.

### The Playable Strategy: What Temu is Doing Right

1. **Simple Games**:  
   Temu incorporates easy-to-solve puzzles and simple games like penalty shoot as the first layer of engagement. These puzzles are low-pressure but intriguing enough to hook users.
   * **Why It Works**: Simple game action triggers an immediate sense of accomplishment, priming users for the next action.
2. **Interactive End Cards**:  
   Instead of generic CTAs, Temuâ€™s end cards let users interact further â€“ browse items, explore deals, or â€œunlockâ€ offers by completing actions.
   * **Why It Works**: Interactive end cards give users a taste of the shopping experience, making the transition to the app feel seamless and rewarding. and of course â€“ FOMO!
3. **Shopping Simulations**:  
   Some playables mimic the actual shopping experience, allowing users to browse items, add them to a cart, and even see discounts applied.
   * **Why It Works**: Giving users a hands-on preview of the app builds familiarity and lowers the barrier to entry. If itâ€™s already in the cart, you are only one step away from buying right?

### Why This Approach Stands Out

In a space where most e-commerce ads rely on static visuals or video ads, Temu is blazing a trail with its playable strategy:

* **Engagement First**: The mix of simple games and interactivity ensures users are engaged and prepared for receiving the message.
* **Almost like buying**: By simulating the actual shopping experience, Temu takes the user to the feeling he is already shopping â€“ and breaks the first barrier.
* **Cross-Industry Inspiration**: Theyâ€™re borrowing proven mechanics from gaming playables and adapting them for e-commerce, creating a fresh perspective on how to engage users.
* **Think Beyond the CTA**: Temuâ€™s playables show that CTAs can be more than just â€œDownload Now.â€ Get a bonus, receive a discount, shop now or lose, you already fear that you miss out on it huh?

## Playable Ad That Made Me Install a Game This Month

Every month, I come across hundreds of playable ads while I play other games. But only from time to time the ad/playable is so good that it makes me install the game as a completely natural process. This monthâ€™s winner? My Baby Unicorn â€“ Pony Care by TutoTOONS. I know itâ€™s for young audience â€“ but playable with pooping unicorn on the toilet? Yes please!

### What Made This Playable Stand Out?

1. **Unexpected Humor**: Playables often lean on drama, action, or puzzles. But a unicorn on a toilet? Thatâ€™s a curveball. The humor and absurdity caught me completely off guard in the best way possible.
2. **Interaction That Feels Fun**: Fart a lot, make a mess, clean it up and make the unicorn happy. I am a child I know and they got me.
3. **Relatable for All Ages**: Sure, itâ€™s targeted at kids, but the humor is universal. Who wouldnâ€™t crack a smile at the sheer absurdity of a unicorn bathroom adventure?
4. **Itâ€™s Memorable**: In a sea of similar playables, this one stuck with me for its sheer uniqueness.
