   ### â ï¸â Marketability tests are DEAD! Do this instead by Matej Lancaric

   Marketability tests donât work the way most studios think. CTR â  CPI. Clickers â  players. In this episode, Matej tears down the biggest misconceptions about testing ideas, shows why personas donât matter in 2025, and walks step-by-step through the exact CPI test setup he uses for real market validation. What youâll learn â¢ Why CTR tests are misleading and often pointless â¢ How CPI tests simulate the real user funnel â¢ Why personas are outdated and concepts rule everything â¢ When to use APK vs landing page â¢ How to set up Meta campaigns correctly â¢ Why estimated CPI is usually 1.5â2Ã off the real CPI â¢ What to do when thereâs no clear winner â¢ How to interpret CPI results properly Key takeaway If you're not running CPI tests, you're not testing.

   2D AGO

   ### â°â D2C is the highest ROI strategy in mobile right now & the clock is ticking! Are you ready?

   In this ultra-special episode, Chip Thurston (FastSpring) returns to break down the current reality of D2C - whatâs allowed today, whatâs changing, and why publishers need to act immediately. We unpack the EpicâGoogle settlement, the new fee structure, whatâs enforceable (and what probably isnât), and why Japan's new regulation on December 18 will reshape global payments. What youâll learn â¢ Why iOS and Android steering IS legal right now â¢ Why publishers shouldnât wait for âfinal clarityâ â¢ How to use D2C purchase data to optimize UA â¢ How attribution to webshops actually works â¢ The truth about Googleâs 20% vs 9% fee categories â¢ Why the judge is skeptical of the GoogleâEpic settlement â¢ How social steering, landing pages, and Discord avoid fees â¢ Why Japanâs new law will supercharge D2C â¢ The strategic window publishers must seize NOW Key takeaway The publishers who act NOW - not when rules are âfinalâ will own the highest-value customers for years.

   ### The next evolution of Roguelites is finally here by Jakub Remiar

   Roguelites have dominated mobile and Steam for three years â Survivor IO, Vampire Survivors, Habiâs new games, and a wave of Steam hits. But the genre is hitting a wall: every run resets too much, and long-term progression is stuck in 2018. In this solo episode, Jakub breaks down the next evolution of the roguelite genre: the imprint system â a mechanic where each run becomes a permanent resource. What youâll learn â¢ Why traditional roguelites suffer from harsh resets â¢ How Uma Musume solved the progression problem with ârun â characterâ imprints â¢ How Chaos Zero Nightmare created a more accessible imprint system â¢ Why deckbuilders (Slay the Spire-style) handle imprints perfectly â¢ Why MegaBong, Bonk roguelites, and Ball X-Pit are missing the key feature â¢ How imprint systems increase retention, investment, and buildcraft â¢ Why the next Western roguelite hit will use this mechanic â¢ Why Habi, Supercell, and 4X devs will adopt it in 2026 Key takeaway The future of roguelites is simple: your best run should never die â it should become your next strongest asset.

   ### Ball X-Pit Review: The Most Innovative Game of 2025?

   Ball X-Pit is one of the most creative roguelite hits on Steam - a blend of Arkanoid, Vampire Survivors, and base-building meta that delivers insane depth. In this episode, we dive into the full gameplay loop, the fission/fusion/evolution system, the âtwo games in oneâ base mechanic, and why this could be a massive mobile hit if executed properly. What youâll learn â¢ How Ball X-Pit sold 367k units & $4.4M in under a week â¢ Why its roguelite mechanics go deeper than Balatro/MegaBong â¢ How fission â evolution â fusion creates multi-layer combos â¢ The innovative base-building/harvesting system â¢ Why itâs trending on Steam, TikTok, Reddit, and Twitch â¢ Why this will definitely come to mobile â¢ Why Devolver publishing matters for reach & discovery Key takeaway Ball X-Pit proves that roguelites can still innovate - especially when they merge physics, skill, and deep buildcraft with a completely new meta layer.

   NOV 27

   ### West Game II Review: Is cloning Kingshot enough?

   West Game 2 is the first real King Shot clone built by a Chinese 4X team acquired by Tripledot, layered on top of Frozen City / Whiteout Survival onboarding, and wrapped in Western cowboy aesthetics. In this breakdown, we dive into: â¢ Full onboarding â Lucky Luke opener â King Shot 1:1 copy â¢ Frozen City mechanics, chapter quests, invasion timers â¢ Why 4X innovation happens only in onboarding, not the core â¢ Webshops & D2C: now up to 50% of revenue for some studios â¢ The creative madness: Red Dead cinematics, Idle Lumber, Goblins, Save the Dog, Lens of Jail, ASMR mining, drama Playrix, Sims life-sims, TikTok memes â¢ Why running 1000 creatives in 30 days is ânormalâ now â¢ And how they cloned King Shotâs onboarding in under 7 months Key takeaway West Game 2 is proof: onboarding = everything. Whoever controls the first 10 minutes controls CPIâ¦ and 4X revenue.
