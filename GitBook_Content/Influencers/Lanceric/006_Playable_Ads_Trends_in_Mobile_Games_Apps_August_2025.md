As the UA landscape evolves, so do the creative trends that shape how games communicate with their audiences. With the rise of Applovin and increased spend on SDK networks, I’ve decided to bring you a monthly trends review of top-performing playable ads across different genres. 
For those that read only summaries, here are playable trends August in a nutshell:

Good old playable classics are back? Time will tell but this month, it seems to be all about classic games
Puzzle trend 

Loads and loads of same playable with different image. Classic 3×3 puzzle game. Some sales guys must have done great job selling single template to all the companies in august.


Knife throwing variations and their revival

Another long-time-no-see is knife throwing gameplay. Throw it and earn rewards. Haven’t seen it for a while but started popping out in august.


Bingo evergreen

Is it casino or a regular game? Who knows, who cares, important is that bingo games keep flooding the playable market, mostly for one simple reason – their gameplay is easy, straightforward and thus replicable in playables.


Playable Ad That Made Me Install a Game This Month

Spot the difference! Oh man one of my favorite games from childhood, back then in magazines and newspapers of course.
It is not just playables they do right, but the creatives as well.
AI images in app stores, Simpson-like characters and other themed imaginery. 
Playable strategy straight from the cookbook – end cards, 1-3 clicks, 5+ clicks, they use it all!




I am puzzled by this Puzzle trend
August was a month filled with déjà vu in the world of playable ads, as countless companies seemed to adopt the exact same format for their campaigns. The classic 3×3 puzzle game dominated the scene: white background, a simple icon, and a 3×3 jigsaw image to solve. It felt like every other ad was a variation of the same template, swapping out just the images and icons.
It’s hard not to wonder if some sales rep did an incredible job pitching this template to multiple companies at once. The sheer volume of these ads suggests that a single, standardized template was mass-sold and distributed to brands, leading to a flood of near-identical playables across platforms. Btw, the same template with many variations is readily available in tools like PlayableMaker, which offers even more customizable options for creative managers looking to keep things fresh.
While the 3×3 puzzle mechanic is undeniably simple and effective, its oversaturation raises concerns about creativity in the playable ad space. It’s a great template for quick engagement, but when every company uses the same template without adding anything on top of it, it risks blending into the noise rather than standing out.
This trend highlights the importance of innovation, even within tried-and-true mechanics. While templates can provide a solid starting point, brands need to think beyond cookie-cutter solutions to create unique, memorable experiences. After all, the goal of a playable ad is to capture attention and in a sea of similarity, that’s becoming increasingly difficult.

Knife throw revival?
Knife throwing gameplay made a surprising comeback in August, reviving a mechanic that had largely been out of the spotlight for a bit. The premise is simple yet satisfying: throw knives at a target, hit the bullseye, and earn rewards. 
What makes knife-throwing playables appealing is their simplicity, while not being static. I’ll explain – simple playables are usually a bit static, like end cards where only pointer is visible. Throwing a knife does not require any special thinking from the user, simply tap and throw, while the spinning wheel with the targets keeps the user busy. 
The revival of knife-throwing gameplay is a reminder that even older, familiar formats can find new life when reintroduced at the right time. However, for these templates to truly stand out, developers and marketers need to add fresh twists or unique visuals to ensure they capture attention in a competitive ad landscape. Creativity, as always, is key to turning a simple mechanic into an unforgettable experience.

Bingo evergreen
Bingo remains a constant presence in the playable ad market, and for good reason. Whether it’s a casino-style game or a more casual one, it’s hard to tell and honestly, who cares? What matters is that bingo games continue to flood the market, capitalizing on their simplicity and universal appeal.
The beauty of bingo lies in its easy, straightforward gameplay, which makes it an ideal candidate for playables. The core mechanic is marking matching numbers. This is both engaging and requires minimal explanation, allowing players to jump right into the action. This simplicity also makes it highly replicable, which is why so many variations of bingo-themed playables exist.
From a marketing perspective, bingo’s wide appeal is a major asset. Whether targeting casual gamers or those who enjoy light gambling experiences, bingo seamlessly adapts to both audiences. Its nostalgic roots and familiar gameplay ensure that it consistently draws attention, even in a saturated ad space.
Ultimately, bingo continues to dominate because it delivers what playable ads are all about: quick, accessible fun that draws players in instantly, and after opening playing the same game user saw in the ad. 


Playable Ad That Made Me Install a Game This Month
Spot the Difference! One of my all-time favorite games from childhood, back when it was found in magazines and newspapers, has made a triumphant return in digital form. At least into my phone:)
The game, Differences – Find & Spot It, doesn’t just excel in its playable ads but also nails the creative execution. Using AI-generated visuals in its app store previews, lookalike characters from The Simpsons, The Jetsons, and The Flintstones and using nostalgia with classic gameplay – they seem to know what they are doing.
Their playable ad strategy is straight out of the ultimate playbook. They use strategy that works = using multiple types of playables by combining end cards, 1-3 click playables, and 5+ click variations to keep their ads fresh. Each approach is designed to boost interaction and showcase the gameplay mechanics.
This combination of creativity, nostalgia, and smart strategy makes “Differences – Find & Spot It” stand out in the crowded market. It’s no surprise that it caught my attention and earned a spot on my device!
