### [Influencer pricing has officially gone off the rails.](https://www.gamigion.com/influencer-pricing-has-officially-gone-off-the-rails/)

This week alone, I saw:- a mid tier creator quoting a $400 CPM- an agency trying to sell a â€œguaranteed 5K installsâ€ package- a creator adding a 40% fee because â€œCPMs rise in Q4â€Some of these numbers would make sense if performance justified it.But most of the time, it doesnâ€™t. The truth is simple.Influencers charging more isnâ€™t the issue.The issue is when price stops reflecting reach, audience quality, and expected outcomes.Hereâ€™s my rule of thumb when evaluating creator pricing.If the quote makes sense in the context of the creatorâ€™s past performance, audience geography, and content quality, great.If not, I move on. No hard feelings. No drama. Just data.Whatâ€™s the wildest quote youâ€™ve received this year?Share your example in the comments. Iâ€™m curious how far the industry has gone.
