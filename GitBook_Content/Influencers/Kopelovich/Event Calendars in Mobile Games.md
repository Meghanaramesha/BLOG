### [ðŸŽ¯ Event Calendars in Mobile Games](https://www.gamigion.com/%f0%9f%8e%af-event-calendars-in-mobile-games/)

Some games (likeÂ SOULSÂ andÂ Capybara Go!) now feature a built-inÂ event calendarÂ that lets players see current and upcoming events directly inside the game.Why itâ€™s interesting:âœ… Builds anticipation â€” players know whatâ€™s coming next.âœ… Reduces churn â€” fewer surprises = more planned engagement.âœ… Strengthens event monetization â€” players can prep resources (and wallets ðŸ’³).Of course, only larger live-ops teams can realistically run and maintain this at scale. But itâ€™s a great reminder of howÂ transparency + planning toolsÂ can boost player trust and retention.ðŸ‘‰ Would you add an event calendar to your game, or do you prefer to keep things more spontaneous?
