I watched Novemberâ€™s #1 AppLovin ad frame by frame.  
Installed the game twice by accident.  
Not even mad. Taking notes.

SuperPlay did the one thing weâ€™re all desperately trying to crack:  
a complex standalone playable that tops the charts.  
  
Itâ€™s built on three psychological triggers:  
  
**ðŸ”— Manufactured Commitment**  
You spawned on the saga map.  
Your brain treats this like progress you made.  
The next tap is free. So is the one after that.  
  
**ðŸ’¥ Maximum Dopamine Per Tap**  
One tap. Confetti everywhere.  
The game isnâ€™t impressed with you.  
Itâ€™s just very, very enthusiastic about keeping you here.  
  
**ðŸ’The 90% Trap**  
Rats run faster as they approach food.  
Nobody abandons a punch card at 9/10.  
Players will download an entire game to open a box.  
  
The best playables donâ€™t promise a reward.  
They make you protect the progress you never made.
