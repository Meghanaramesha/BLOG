### [Influencer pricing has officially gone off the rails.](https://www.gamigion.com/influencer-pricing-has-officially-gone-off-the-rails/)

This week alone, I saw:- a mid tier creator quoting a $400 CPM- an agency trying to sell a “guaranteed 5K installs” package- a creator adding a 40% fee because “CPMs rise in Q4”Some of these numbers would make sense if performance justified it.But most of the time, it doesn’t. The truth is simple.Influencers charging more isn’t the issue.The issue is when price stops reflecting reach, audience quality, and expected outcomes.Here’s my rule of thumb when evaluating creator pricing.If the quote makes sense in the context of the creator’s past performance, audience geography, and content quality, great.If not, I move on. No hard feelings. No drama. Just data.What’s the wildest quote you’ve received this year?Share your example in the comments. I’m curious how far the industry has gone.
