***PIF Uncertainty, AppLovin’s Quiet iOS Power Play, and Kingshot’s $500M UA Masterclass***

The mobile industry is splitting into two realities.

Capital is tightening at the top just as a new wave of UA innovation is unlocking the next half-billion-dollar games. For studio leaders, this is a moment to read the signals clearly: exits may slow, but the teams that master onboarding and cross-genre funnels will keep compounding.

### PIF Slowdown: The Exit Engine Is Cooling

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has been the backstop for large gaming acquisitions for years. Now it’s signaling a pullback as cash reserves tighten after high-burn bets in unrelated sectors like EVs, cruise lines, and Neom’s stalled megaprojects.

**Why this matters for studio leaders:**

• Fewer mega-acquisitions means fewer recycled founder windfalls re-entering the ecosystem.  
• Fewer exits shifts pressure to profitability, sticky LTV design, and sustainable UA.  
• The “big buyer” not firing checks every quarter changes late-stage studio behavior across the board.

PIF still holds massive influence. Through Savvy Games, it controls Scopely and Niantic, holds equity in Nintendo, Nexon, Capcom, and Take-Two, and is part of the ongoing $55B EA acquisition set for FYQ1 2027. The ecosystem won’t freeze, but the era of frictionless capital is over.

Plan your studio roadmap assuming exits take longer. Build value through retention, content pacing, and monetization depth rather than valuation storytelling.

### Kingshot’s $500M Funnel: A Playbook Every Studio Should Study

Century Games’ **Kingshot** has now crossed **$542M** in nine months, one of the fastest-growing strategy launches in years. But the headline isn’t the revenue. It’s *how* they got there.

**The breakthrough:**

Kingshot disguises a 4X game behind a casual onboarding funnel that lasts nearly 20 minutes.  
This lowers CPIs dramatically, bypassing the genre’s biggest acquisition bottleneck.

**Why this matters:**

• 4X monetizes extremely well.  
• 4X also has some of the highest CPIs on mobile.  
• A casual-style first session flips the economics of the genre.

This funnel blueprint is now bleeding into other high-stakes verticals like social casino. The result is a new generation of midcore games with casual-looking acquisition surfaces and deep monetization cores underneath.

**Revenue geography:**

• US accounts for 42% of total spend  
• Korea 9%  
• Japan 7%

Genre-blending funnels are becoming a requirement, not an experiment. Your first 10–20 minutes are now part of your UA strategy, not just onboarding.

### UA Dynamics: AppLovin’s iOS Climb & Remarketing Shift

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Applovin.jpg)

The latest AppsFlyer index shows a UA market that’s tighter, smarter, and more competitive than ever.

#### AppLovin is quietly catching Apple on iOS

Apple Ads still leads, but the gap has collapsed from 43 percent to 28 percent. This is driven by:  
• Privacy changes leveling the field  
• AppLovin’s creative and ML edge  
• Apple’s limited ad inventory vs AppLovin’s full-network footprint

AppLovin dominates in North America and Europe while Apple holds Japan, Greater China, and Korea.

#### Android stays Google’s kingdom

Google remains number one across nearly every mobile genre. AppLovin is second and even surpasses Google in match games in Eastern Europe.

#### Remarketing moves from “nice to have” to default

As CPIs rise, studios are shifting spend:  
• Remarketing conversions are up 20 percent YoY  
• More teams now run structured re-engagement loops  
• It’s often cheaper to reactivate than acquire new users

This is especially true for any game with deep content or economy progression.

The next growth wave is less about finding new users and more about recycling existing ones with better segmentation, creative, and timing.

### The Bottom Line for Studio Leaders

The macro picture is tightening while the operational picture is getting more innovative.

**The winners in 2026–2027 will be the studios that:**

• Treat onboarding as a UA channel  
• Blend casual acquisition with midcore or casino monetization  
• Build remarketing into their core UA system  
• Reduce dependence on large exits and focus on operational profitability  
• Align creative and product cycles around a world where AppLovin, Apple, and Google are reshaping the rules quarterly

This is the new mobile landscape.  
Studios who adapt early will own it.
