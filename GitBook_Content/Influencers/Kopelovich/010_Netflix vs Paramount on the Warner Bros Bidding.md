*It’s not “we want to talk.”*

This is a live, financed, all cash bid aimed straight at WBD’s shareholder base.

---

#### TL;DR

1. **Cash on the table**
   * “Paramount is basically telling WBD: forget complex spin offs and Netflix stock. Here is 30 dollars per share, all cash, for the entire company.”
2. **Regulators vs gravity**
   * “Netflix has the strategic logic, Paramount has the regulatory story. Shareholders are stuck between headline synergy and antitrust reality.”
3. **For games, the question is the owner, not the sale**
   * “Rocksteady, NetherRealm, TT Games and co are getting a new parent either way. The real question is whether they plug into Netflix’s subscription funnel or into a rebuilt Paramount plus HBO plus sports stack.”

### 1. What Paramount puts on the table

**Paramount Skydance offer**

* **Price**: $30 per WBD share, **ALL CASH**.
* **Implied enterprise value**: about $**108.4 billion** for the whole of WBD, including Global Networks
* **Cash vs Netflix**: Paramount says its bid gives WBD shareholders **$18 billion more in cash** than the Netflix consideration
* **Scope**: buys **all of WBD** – studios, HBO, streaming, sports, plus Global Networks. No leftover “spinco” stub.
* **Structure**: hostile **tender offer directly to shareholders**, expiring 8 January 2026 unless extended
* **Financing**:  
  Equity backstopped by the **Ellison family** and **RedBird Capital**  
  Around **$54 billion** in fully committed debt from **Bank of America, Citi & Apollo**

### 2. How it stacks up vs the Netflix deal

**Netflix Agreement (already signed with WBD)**

* **Price**: 27.75 dollars per share
  + 23.25 dollars in cash
  + About $4.5 in Netflix stock (with a collar)
* **Enterprise value**: about **82.7 billion dollars**
* **Scope**: Netflix buys the **Warner Bros studios + HBO + games + streaming**, but **not** the linear networks, which go into a separate Discovery Global spin off
* **Timing and risk**: Netflix itself is guiding to **12 to 18 months** of multi region antitrust review, including heavy scrutiny in the US and EU, with breakup fees if it fails.

### **Paramount’s main arguments**

Paramount is basically telling WBD shareholders:

1. **Higher headline price**
   * 30 dollars vs 27.75 dollars per share
   * All cash vs a cash plus stock mix
2. **Cleaner structure**
   * You sell **the entire company**, no “orphan” Global Networks stub with leverage and uncertain trading value.
3. **Regulatory story**
   * Paramount + WBD creates a **stronger challenger to Netflix and Disney**, not a streaming giant with around 40 plus percent global SVOD share. That is how they will sell it to regulators. [PR Newswire+1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   * Netflix deal is framed as anticompetitive and slow. Paramount is pitching its deal as **more likely and faster** to clear.
4. **Execution risk**
   * Netflix has never digested a mega acquisition of this size before.
   * Paramount is positioning itself as the “Hollywood native” that knows how to integrate studios and networks.

---

### 3. What it means right now

* **WBD board still officially backs the Netflix deal.** The boards of Netflix and WBD have signed a merger agreement. Any switch to Paramount could trigger a **multi billion dollar breakup fee** in Netflix’s favor. [TechCrunch+1](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/how-would-the-netflix-warner-bros-deal-reshape-hollywood/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Paramount is going over the board’s head.** The tender offer is aimed straight at shareholders with the message “your board did not engage properly; here is a clearly superior alternative.” [PR Newswire+1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Regulators just became even more central.**
  + Netflix: massive vertical and horizontal integration in streaming, clear big tech narrative, lots of antitrust heat.
  + Paramount: more “traditional” studio plus networks combo. Still large, but easier to present as pro competitive compared to a Netflix mega stack.

We are now in **full bidding war territory**, with Netflix’s signed deal sitting in the middle as the thing Paramount is trying to blow up.

---

### 4. WB Games Angle

Under **either** deal, WB Games and its studios (Rocksteady, NetherRealm, TT Games, Avalanche, WB Montréal) are part of the package.

The difference is the strategic parent:

* **Netflix scenario**
  + Games sit inside a subscription plus transmedia machine that already leans hard into mobile and cross platform experiments.
  + Strong push into “games as retention lever” for 270 million members, low focus on traditional UA, heavy focus on IP driven engagement loops.
* **Paramount scenario**
  + Games become part of a **Hollywood plus sports plus broadcast** cluster that needs a stronger DTC play.
  + Paramount is signaling more belief in theatrical plus event content, and a “bigger Hollywood” vision with higher content spend and more theatrical releases, which could also drive more classic licensed titles and franchise games.

From a pure **Mobile & Games Ecosystem** point of view:

* Netflix winning would centralize even more IP plus games inside one subscription giant.
* Paramount winning would keep Netflix as an external competitor, while creating another big IP plus games plus streaming stack rather than folding more power into Netflix.
