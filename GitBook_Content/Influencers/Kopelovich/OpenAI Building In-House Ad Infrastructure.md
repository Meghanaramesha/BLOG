OpenAI building internal advertising capability could be a classic case of "dog-fooding." They'll test their tools on themselves first before releasing them widely to external customers. Honestly, not surprising. The classic tech growth sequence usually goes like thisFree â†’ Massive user growth â†’ Monetization â†’ AdsGoogle did it. Meta did it.
