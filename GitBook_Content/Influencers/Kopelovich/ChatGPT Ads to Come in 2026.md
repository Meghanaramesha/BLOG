ChatGPT Android beta code reveals potential Ad Modules that could appear alongside search or shopping queries.

#### Itâ€™s not about â€œSearch Adsâ€ vs â€œAIâ€.

*First time an LLM becomes a real Paid Media Ecosystemâ€¦*

Sam Altman just confirmed it.

So, yeah.

ChatGPT will begin testing ads.

But these ads will not resemble traditional Google model. No search. No blue links. No ad slots in sidebars.

#### RUMORS About Gemini?

There were rumours going on about that.

â€œGoogle Tells Advertisers Itâ€™s Bringing Ads to Gemini in 2026.â€

#### But?

As always, I did a deep dive for you and saw that itâ€™s wrong.   
Saw on TWITTER. (Yep, youâ€™re right. X.)

According to [Google VP of Global Ads Dan Taylor:](https://x.com/edantaylor/status/1998112845813448861?s=20)

> This story is based on uninformed, anonymous sources who are making inaccurate claims. There are no ads in the Gemini app and there are **no current plans to change that.**

### ChatGPTâ€™s Core Shift?

Google makes money when you click because you did not get the answer.  
ChatGPT plans to make money when it gets the answer rightâ€¦

This is a new logic for digital media.  
Accuracy becomes monetization.  
Relevance becomes inventory.  
AI intent becomes targeting.

For performance marketers, this matters.

### What We Know So Far

#### Rollout

Closed beta in 2025. Global launch for free users in 2026.

#### Pricing

Charged per click or action.  
No impression-based inflation.

#### Placement

Ads appear **inside** the conversation.  
Native to the reply. No pop-ups.

#### Targeting

Semantic intent, session context and user memory (if enabled).  
No keyword-era targeting.

#### User Control

Users can disable memory to reduce personalization.

#### Formats

* Sponsored answers.
* Promoted GPTs.
* Contextual tool suggestions.
* Action buttons blended into replies.

#### Attribution

Session tokens or conversion APIs. No cookies.

*AI becomes an intent capture layer that lives upstream of Google.*

### Why It Matters to Mobile Ad Tech

Mobile UA has been shaped for a decade by three pillars:  
Search intent. Social discovery. SDK monetization.

*In 2026, LLMs add a fourth pillar.*  
A conversational intent layer.

**For mobile performance teams, this means:**

â€¢ Higher purchase intent in fewer steps  
â€¢ Targeting based on problem statements, not demographics  
â€¢ Recommendations delivered at the exact emotional trigger point  
â€¢ Zero friction between question and action  
â€¢ New top-of-funnel and mid-funnel territory before Meta and Google  
â€¢ Campaigns built around conversations, not creatives

AI becomes the new inventory surface.  
Context becomes the new placement.

#### Industryâ€™s Take?

### Replacing Google?

*â€œChatGPT ads will kill Google Ads.â€*

Not yet.  
**Hereâ€™s why:**

â€¢ Google still owns peak intent  
â€¢ Google has twenty years of conversion data  
â€¢ Performance teams want predictable and scalable outcomes  
â€¢ ChatGPT is strong for discovery, Google still dominates demand capture  
â€¢ Google has mature attribution, APIs and cross-channel measurement

ChatGPT does not replace Google.  
It adds a **new layer above it**.

Think of it as pre-search.  
The place where questions start.  
Not where they finish.
