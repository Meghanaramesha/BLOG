[Devsisters’](https://www.devsisters.com/) Cookie Run just crossed 300M players globally.

16 years in, Devsisters shows what real IP compounding looks like.

#### Sorry, how big?

You name it.

*$740M out of 136M Downloads.*

#### IP-driven & Organic-heavy

Not a classic giant like Dream Games.   
Quite opposite of Fully Paid UA.

Almost 2M [YouTube Subs](https://www.youtube.com/@CookieRunKingdom/videos). You’d be shocked to see their views count!  
Attached some of their videos in the end. Check that out. 🦧

*Their Games’ songs listens?* 👇🏻

**Why it matters for Mobile Gaming Studios**

• **$1B+** lifetime revenue built on a single expanding universe proves IP outperforms product.  
• Strong activity in the **U.S, China, Korea** shows the fandom travels.  
• Music, videos, merch, offline culture collabs… Cookie Run is now a full-spectrum brand, not just a game.  
• They broke genre walls with ‘Auto Battler RPG, Runner, Match-3, Blast, Habby-style Action RPG’ *under one IP.*

#### **The real unlock: IP economics**

IP exists to turn a creative idea into an **infinitely reproducible economic engine**.

Disney, Marvel, Pokémon, Riot, Supercell, Nintendo, WB… all the giants are IP companies first, product companies second.

Devsisters is playing the same game.

#### **IP gives mobile studios five unfair advantages**

1. **Lower CAC**  
   Brand recall makes UA cheaper and download curves more organic.
2. **Higher LTV**  
   Players spend across multiple titles inside the same universe.
3. **Cross-genre flexibility**  
   One IP can fuel RPG, Puzzle, Action, Casual, Console, Animation.
4. **Risk spread**  
   A single title can fail, the IP doesn’t.
5. **Compounding value**  
   IPs don’t fade. They age, reboot, expand and attach to new generations.

#### **The evolution of global IP in one breath**

• **1950-80 Brand Era**  
Characters became emotional assets. Mickey Mouse school.  
One character → infinite products.

• **1980-2005 Franchise Era**  
Star Wars proved a universe can power toys, books, games, licensing.

• **2005+ Transmedia Era**  
Pokémon, Marvel, Riot, Rovio turned IP into multi-channel ecosystems  
games, film, anime, esports, music, social, merch  
all alive at once.

#### **The Cookie Run lesson**

A Korean-born IP with a mostly female audience now drives **US-heavy revenue**, racks up millions of organic views, builds a loyal creator base, and sustains 16 years of global relevance.

This is the mobile IP playbook.  
Not paid UA. Not one-off hits.  
**Compounding worlds that print demand.**

If you want mobile games that scale for a decade  
you build IP, not just games.
