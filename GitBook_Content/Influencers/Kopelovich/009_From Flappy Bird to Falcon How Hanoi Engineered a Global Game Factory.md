Vietnam became the world’s #1 mobile game exporter. The story of how that happened starts with a guy who wanted to quit

#### The Spark That Didn’t Want to Be a Fire

In April 2013, most of Hanoi was in the streets celebrating Reunification Day, the annual holiday marking the end of the American War. But in a bedroom in Van Phuc, a silk-making village on the outskirts of the city, a 28-year-old programmer sat alone with his iPhone and a poster of Mario.

Dong Nguyen had a day job programming GPS devices for taxis. He made games on the side because he missed the simplicity of the Nintendo games he’d grown up playing on cloned consoles his family could barely afford. That weekend, he built something in three days: a bloated bird, some green pipes, and physics tuned so brutally that even a slight mis-tap meant death.

He called it Flappy Bird.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i2Di!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47b6c684-63fc-4407-befd-f1d1f473c953_640x360.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i2Di!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47b6c684-63fc-4407-befd-f1d1f473c953_640x360.gif)

**Flappy Bird’s binary gameplay:** tap to ascend, stop to die.Mechanically primitive, punishingly difficult. I never made it past Level 12.

For eight months, nothing happened. The first mention on Twitter, five months after launch, was three words: “Fuck Flappy Bird.”

Then, in January 2014, it exploded. Number one in over 100 countries. 50 million downloads. $50,000 a day in ad revenue. Dong Nguyen became a millionaire faster than Mark Zuckerberg.

And then he killed it.

“I am sorry ‘Flappy Bird’ users,” he tweeted at 2:02 AM Hanoi time. “22 hours from now, I will take ‘Flappy Bird’ down. I cannot take this anymore.”

Ten million people downloaded it in those final 22 hours. Then it was gone.

When Rolling Stone finally tracked him down, hiding at a friend’s apartment to escape the paparazzi camped outside his parents’ house, he explained his decision with five words that would define everything that came after:

> “I’m master of my own fate.” (Ref 1)

## The Two Vietnams

Here’s something outsiders don’t understand about Vietnam’s tech scene: Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are different countries wearing the same flag.

HCMC is the commercial engine. Louder, faster, more connected to global capital. It’s where you go if you want a corporate job at a multinational. The “Silicon Valley energy,” as one founder who relocated from the Bay Area put it. (Ref 2)

Hanoi is older, quieter, more stubborn. It’s where you go if you want to be left alone. If you want to build something on your own terms.

When Gameloft, the French gaming company, opened Vietnam’s first major game studio in 2004, they chose Saigon, what the French historically called HCMC. It made sense. That’s where the infrastructure was, where the business class spoke English, where the talent wanted stable jobs with international companies.

Seven years later, they opened a second studio in Hanoi. And then something interesting happened.

The HCMC Gameloft alumni largely stayed in corporate gaming, moving to VNG, the Vietnamese tech giant, or other established players. But the Hanoi alumni started leaving to build their own studios.

By the early 2010s, a wave of independent entrepreneurship had begun. Senspark. Amanotes. ABI. And in April 2010 (three years before Flappy Bird) four close friends founded a company called OneSoft.

Those four friends are now CEOs of four separate studios: Falcon Game Studio, Rocket Game Studio, ABI Game Studio, and Monster Game Studio. All still headquartered in Hanoi. All still fiercely independent.

> “There’s a sense in Vietnam of ‘I want to be my own boss,’” one HCMC developer told Southeast Asia Globe. “Everyone wants to be an entrepreneur.” (Ref 3)

That’s true. But in Hanoi, it’s something more specific. It’s not just entrepreneurship. It’s a way of life, a refusal to be absorbed. A commitment to staying small enough to stay free.

Dong Nguyen embodied it when he pulled Flappy Bird. The OneSoft founders embodied it when they split into four studios rather than build one empire. It’s the same instinct, expressed in different ways.

The question is: can you scale that?

---

## The Hanoi Factory

The answer, it turns out, is yes…if you change what you’re scaling.

Dong Nguyen built Flappy Bird on intuition. Three days, one idea, no marketing, no plan. High variance. He won the lottery, and then he walked away from it.

The studios that followed learned a different lesson. Not “how do we get lucky?” but “how do we make luck repeatable?”

Take Falcon Game Studio, one of the four OneSoft spinoffs, founded in 2017. Their founding story sounds almost quaint: a small team in Hanoi, passionate about games, dreaming of global reach.

But look at what they’ve built: the first Vietnamese studio to hit $1 million in In-App Purchase revenue for a single game (1945 Air Force). Multiple titles with 100 million+ downloads. A publishing arm that helps other Vietnamese indie developers go global.

Their stated mission: “To be the pioneer to bring Vietnam’s in-app game production industry closer to the world.”

This isn’t the language of an indie studio hoping for a hit. This is the language of infrastructure.

## The Decade of Struggle

Or take iKame Global, the current global poster child for the Hanoi scene, and perhaps the clearest example of what systematic game-building looks like.

Nguyen Manh Quyet founded iKame in 2014, the same year Flappy Bird died. He also serves as both CEO and chairman of the Vietnam Game Development Association. But when he talks about the industry’s rise, he doesn’t talk about luck. He talks about time.

“Success didn’t come overnight,” Quyet has said. “It took the Vietnamese gaming industry a decade of struggle, with developers having to find their own paths, often without sufficient manpower or experience.” (Ref 4)

That decade shows in iKame’s approach. Where Dong Nguyen built one game in three days and walked away, iKame built nine games in the same genre before they found their breakout. (Ref 5)

The genre was screw puzzles, a niche so specific it barely registers in Western gaming discourse. Players unscrew bolts to disassemble objects. That’s it. Simple mechanics, infinite variations.

iKame’s first major hit in the genre was Screw Out, launched in April 2024. It generated $14 million in revenue and nearly 20 million downloads.A success by any measure. But iKame treated it as a prototype.

Eight months later, they launched Screwdom, and the numbers went vertical.

The game now drives significant ad revenue alone, with over 200,000 daily downloads. Players average more than 100 minutes per day, outpacing Candy Crush (66 minutes) and Royal Match (88 minutes). (Ref 6)

What changed between Screw Out and Screwdom? Iteration. iKame shifted from 2D to 3D rendering. It wasn’t just a cosmetic polish, but a mechanical upgrade that made puzzles more tactile and challenging. They refined the difficulty curve and optimized the monetization balance.

And underneath it all, they built a prediction machine.

At Vietnam Game Connect 2025, iKame demonstrated their in-house BI platform: a four-layer tech stack built on Google Cloud, Looker, Python, and Airflow. The system ingests gameplay data from the first three days after launch and predicts return on ad spend for 30, 180, and even 365 days out.

This is how you make luck repeatable. Not by guessing which game will go viral, but by building systems that tell you—within 72 hours—whether a game is worth scaling.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4_bZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1aaa136a-a191-40be-91b1-a1868ef5ba01_1369x393.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4_bZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1aaa136a-a191-40be-91b1-a1868ef5ba01_1369x393.png)

**iKame:**Net revenue by app (2024 – Nov 2025). Screwdom went from zero to hero, generating an 800% quarter-on-quarter revenue jump in Q3. (Source: SensorTower)

The same levers that matter in Western mobile gaming—segmentation, churn models, pLTV, retargeting, IAP vs. ad monetization balance—are now being deployed by Vietnamese teams at scale. What changes is unit cost, iteration speed, and a deep institutional memory of what “simple but hard” actually means.

> This is the inheritance from Flappy Bird. Dong Nguyen understood something instinctively that Vietnamese studios have since systematized: the most addictive games are mechanically simple but punishingly difficult.

Tap to flap. Unscrew the bolt. Anyone can understand the rules in seconds—but mastery stays just out of reach, pulling players back for one more attempt.

It’s the design philosophy that kept Flappy Bird players averaging 20 sessions per day, and it’s why Screwdom now commands 100+ minutes of daily attention. The genius isn’t in complexity. It’s in the precise calibration of frustration and reward.

iKame released 20+ games in 2024 alone.Most won’t become Screwdom. But they don’t need to. The prediction machine identifies winners early, and the iteration machine makes each winner better than the last.

## The Takeover

And now, the punchline.

At Vietnam Game Connect 2025, a Google representative confirmed what the industry had been whispering: Vietnam achieved 6.7 billion global downloads in 2024, the highest of any country in the world.

Vietnam surpassed China.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jijD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9e07b39-a51d-4123-a613-5298aa0470bd_1240x827.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jijD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9e07b39-a51d-4123-a613-5298aa0470bd_1240x827.jpeg)

**Vietnam isn’t the little brother anymore.** At the historic Google Apps Summit 2025 in Saigon, Marc Woo, Managing Director of Google Vietnam, showcased Vietnam as the undisputed king of Hybrid-Casual, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with titans from China and Japan.

Let that sink in. A country of 100 million people, with a gaming industry that barely existed 15 years ago, now produces more mobile game downloads globally than the People’s Republic of China.

The numbers are almost absurd:

* 37.3% of all mobile games downloaded globally come from Vietnamese developers. That’s roughly 3-4 out of every 10 games. (Ref 8)
* Five Vietnamese companies ranked in the global top 25 publishers by downloads in 2024: VNGGames, iKame, ABI Games Studio, Bravestars, and Xgame Global. (Ref 9)
* iKame and ABI both cracked the global top 10.

The factory is humming, and it’s not entirely a fluke.

The raw talent is here, and it will continue to evolve as more players emerge from the ecosystem. While industry estimates often cite over 3,000 game studios operating in the country, data from GameGeek and AppMagic clarifies the picture: there are **1,062 active store accounts** driving this volume. This suggests a maturing consolidation—it is not just thousands of scattered freelancers anymore, but over a thousand organized entities pushing code to the world stage

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qm82!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb5c2a1a-4fcc-40db-abd6-49df36709584_1626x914.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qm82!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb5c2a1a-4fcc-40db-abd6-49df36709584_1626x914.png)

**Validating the Machine:** This chart proves the raw power of the iteration machine. Vietnam now supplies 40% of the global market by prioritizing manufacturing speed and volume over depth. These 6.7 billion downloads represent a victory for industrial-scale execution.

## The Final Boss

If the last decade was about conquering the leaderboard, the next is about conquering the wallet. Because right now, there is a glitch in the Vietnam success story.

While Vietnam is winning the war for attention, it is losing the war for value. The average revenue per daily active user for a Vietnamese game is just $0.06. The global benchmark? $0.70.

That is a 10x gap.

It reveals the industry’s one lingering weakness: Vietnamese studios are masters of distribution, but they are novices at extraction. They have figured out how to get a game onto 100 million phones, but they haven’t figured out how to get those 100 million players to open their wallets. They are currently building the digital equivalent of penny slots, while the West builds high-stakes poker tables.

However, the sheer volume is starting to amount to serious capital. While publisher In-App Purchase (IAP) revenue currently sits around $486 million annually, industry leaders suggest the true economic footprint is much larger.

Jennifer Vu, CEO of GameGeek, commented in a [recent *DealStreet Asia*article](https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/vietnam-gaming-sector-464698) that the industry has already graduated from its infancy. “Vietnam’s gaming industry pivoted from outsourcing 5-6 years ago to focus on self-publishing globally,” she notes. “That is why we’ve already surpassed the $1-billion mark and are a significant player on the world stage.” (Ref 10)

That billion-dollar figure relies heavily on In-App Advertising (IAA)—the ads players watch between levels. But relying on ads is becoming a dangerous game.

Kelly Wong, CEO of VNGGames, observes a “funding winter” that is splitting the market in two. On one side are the smaller teams relying on user-acquisition-driven casual games; on the other are larger studios attempting to move toward big-budget titles.

“We see player behavior changing whereby they are sticking to existing games and experimenting less with newer titles,” Wong notes. For the industry to mature, it cannot just rely on churning out more ad-supported casual games. It has to solve the revenue puzzle.

“For ARPU to rise, game mechanics would have to change to focus on incentivizing players to pay for items in-game,” Wong says. “This would mean moving past IAA and with a stronger focus on IAP, with good mechanics and business models to create the right loop for players to really invest both time and money.” (Ref 11)

This volume-based model is not without its perils. It relies on razor-thin margins that can be wiped out by a single shift in Facebook’s ad algorithm or a hike in user acquisition costs.

This transition from “watch an ad” to “buy a sword” is technically difficult and financially risky. The smartest founders know this. It’s why iKame’s prediction machine doesn’t just look for downloads anymore; it hunts for “whales” (high spenders). It’s why Falcon is pivoting hard into In-App Purchases. The goal is no longer solely about downloads and eyeballs.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2LkL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd65cfe4e-e161-47de-894e-87e98ed42f9f_2634x1448.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2LkL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd65cfe4e-e161-47de-894e-87e98ed42f9f_2634x1448.png)

**Inside the Prediction Machine:** At Vietnam Game Connect 2025, iKame revealed the infrastructure that powers their data-driven culture. By integrating automated alerts and long-term ROAS predictions into daily workflows, the studio has moved beyond simple reporting to a model where “unified data” breaks down silos between product and marketing.

There’s a harder critique, too. One that circulates in gaming forums and industry circles worldwide: Vietnamese studios copy.

It’s not entirely unfair. The industry’s rise was built on “fast-follow” mechanics. Watching what works on WeChat mini-games or Western app stores, then iterating quickly at lower cost. The screw puzzle genre that made iKame famous didn’t originate in Hanoi. Neither did match-3, idle games, or tower defense. Vietnamese studios perfected execution, not invention.

> Dr. Renusha Athugala, who runs the Game Design program at RMIT Vietnam, puts it bluntly: “Vietnam does not have ‘game designers’—they have ‘game developers.’ Many Vietnamese games are created by developers who lack creative thinking skills, which leads to them being limited in their innovation and creativity, thus the lack of originality.” (Ref 12)

The production mindset, she argues, is a legacy of the outsourcing era. Studios learned to build what clients specified, not to imagine what players hadn’t seen. It’s a skill set optimized for execution, not authorship.

The download numbers confirm scale. The revenue gap reveals uncaptured value. The originality gap reveals the harder problem: Vietnam makes games the world plays, but not yet games only Vietnam could make.

That’s the final boss after the final boss.

## Two Birds

There’s a poetic symmetry here.

Flappy Bird was a spark. One guy. One weekend. One infuriatingly impossible game. Dong Nguyen didn’t want to build an empire. He wanted to be free. And when freedom required walking away from $50,000 a day, he walked.

Falcon Game Studio is what comes after. Four friends who stayed in Hanoi, built four companies, and turned the “master of my own fate” instinct into a repeatable system. They didn’t reject scale…they scaled independence.

From Flappy Bird to Falcon. Two birds. One arc.

Dong’s studio, .Gears, is largely inactive now. Most of its games have been pulled from app stores. (Ref 13) He never wanted to be a factory.

But the cultural current he represented, the Hanoi instinct, the refusal to be absorbed, the belief that you could build something global without becoming a cog, became an industry.

And that industry just became the largest mobile game exporter on Earth.
