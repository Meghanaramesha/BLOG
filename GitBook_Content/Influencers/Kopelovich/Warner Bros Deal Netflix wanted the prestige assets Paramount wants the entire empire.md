Plot twist: [Paramount](https://www.linkedin.com/company/paramountco/) just went full Doctor Evil and said “ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS MWAHAHA” with a hostile takeover bid for [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://www.linkedin.com/company/warner-bros-discovery/), basically stepping in front of [Netflix](https://www.linkedin.com/company/netflix/) and saying not today sunshine.

And they didn’t whisper it they got a megaphone and shouted hard for all of us to hear:  
💰 All cash  
💰 $30/share  
💰 ~$108B total money  
  
That’s massively above Netflix’s $80isn billion offer. When someone adds an extra $25–30bn to the table, they’re not negotiating, they’re making a statement.  
  
Netflix wanted the prestige assets. Paramount wants the entire empire. Bold, risky, and extremely on-brand for a studio trying to reinvent itself post-Skydance merger.  
  
🎮 Now, the gaming angle (aka the part I actually care about)  
  
I’ll be honest: I still prefer Netflix here. They’re the only one treating games as a strategic engine, not a merch and licensing afterthought.  
Paramount has some momentum (thanks, Skydance), but, as I mentioned on Sunday, acquiring [Warner Bros. Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/warnerbrosgames/) means inheriting one of the strongest IP arsenals in the industry, Mortal Kombat, Hogwarts Legacy, DC, Rocksteady, NetherRealm.  
  
Under Netflix? That becomes a transmedia machine and bigger part of their existing gaming focus.   
  
Under Paramount? I have no actual idea.  
  
⚖️ And of course, regulators are about to have a field day.  
  
Deals this big take years to unwind, reshape, and approve, if they get approved at all.  
  
But one thing’s clear:  
This isn’t just a fight over HBO or The Batman.  
This is a battle to control the next decade of Transmedia entertainment, where games sit right at the centre.  
  
I tell you one thing, this industry is nothing if not entertaining 😂  
  
Wrighty out.
