I watched November’s #1 AppLovin ad frame by frame.  
Installed the game twice by accident.  
Not even mad. Taking notes.

SuperPlay did the one thing we’re all desperately trying to crack:  
a complex standalone playable that tops the charts.  
  
It’s built on three psychological triggers:  
  
**🔗 Manufactured Commitment**  
You spawned on the saga map.  
Your brain treats this like progress you made.  
The next tap is free. So is the one after that.  
  
**💥 Maximum Dopamine Per Tap**  
One tap. Confetti everywhere.  
The game isn’t impressed with you.  
It’s just very, very enthusiastic about keeping you here.  
  
**💍The 90% Trap**  
Rats run faster as they approach food.  
Nobody abandons a punch card at 9/10.  
Players will download an entire game to open a box.  
  
The best playables don’t promise a reward.  
They make you protect the progress you never made.
