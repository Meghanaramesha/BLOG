✨ Loved this little UI detail in Magic Sort.

The game uses a multiplier streak mechanic (x2 → x5 → x10 → x25 → x100) during events. What’s clever is how they reinforce it:  
🔹 Once on the win screen (to celebrate the moment)  
🔹 And again in the event progress bar (to keep the pressure/excitement alive)  
  
This dual placement does two things:  
✅ Makes the multiplier feel more tangible and rewarding  
✅ Keeps players aware of the stakes if they break the streak  
  
A simple UI choice — but one that amplifies both engagement and tension.  
  
👉 Would you want to see this mechanic in more casual puzzle games?
