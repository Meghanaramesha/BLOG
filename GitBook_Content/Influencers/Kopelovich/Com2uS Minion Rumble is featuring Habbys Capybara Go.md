\*As far as I know (and after checking around) thereâ€™sÂ no obvious connectionÂ betweenÂ Com2uSÂ andÂ HabbyÂ â€” but I may be mistaken.

ðŸš¨ Thatâ€™s why this cross-promo inÂ Minion RumbleÂ (Com2uS) caught my eye: itâ€™s featuringÂ Capybara Go!, which is published byÂ Habby.  
  
Normally, cross-promotions stayÂ withinÂ a publisherâ€™s own portfolio. But here we see two different companies sharing real estate â€” which suggests either a partnership, a distribution deal, or just a smart test of mutual promotion.  
  
I like how this breaks the usual mold:  
âœ… Expands reach beyond a single publisherâ€™s ecosystem  
âœ… Taps into overlapping audiences of casual players  
âœ… Creates win-win visibility for both titles  
  
A nice reminder that in todayâ€™s crowded mobile space,Â collaboration beats isolation.  
  
ðŸ‘‰ Have you seen other cases where publishers promoteÂ outsideÂ their own catalog?
