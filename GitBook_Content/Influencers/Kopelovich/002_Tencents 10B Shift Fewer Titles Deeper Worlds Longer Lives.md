Tencent just crossed $10B in Global Game Revenue during an industry slowdown.

None of this came from lucky hits. It came from a new operating model that mobile studios should pay attention to.

Because while the headlines talk about PC & Console IP…  
The strategy underneath is also **where Mobile is heading**.

*Cool info to kick it off?*

JFYI, some of Tencent’s investments 👇🏻  
**Supercell, Miniclip & Voodoo…**

#1 answer why Tencent dominates?  
Cuz 👉🏻 THE DEADLINE IS YESTERDAY.

*Yep, you’re right. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯*

> *Tencent is no longer just a passive investor in global games.*  
> The Chinese conglomerate is taking a decidedly hands-on approach, deploying a 1,000-member team to guarantee hits from the 20 up-and-coming global studios it has acquired.

#### 1. Evergreen is the Future of Mobile

Tencent’s biggest wins this year were long-form live games built to last a decade.

*Mobile is already showing the same pattern:*

• fewer launches  
• deeper loops  
• massive long-term roadmaps  
• monetization built on seasons, not spikes

Tencent’s model confirms this direction.  
If your mobile roadmap is still short, you’re behind.

#### 2. IP Will Decide the Next Wave of Mobile Winners

Tencent doubles down on **worlds that matter**: Dune, Dying Light, Path of Exile.

The lesson for mobile:

• raw mechanics are not enough anymore  
• IP boosts UA efficiency  
• IP boosts ROAS  
• IP raises ceiling for retention & LTV

*Studios without IP must build mini-worlds that feel like IP.*

#### 3. Centralized Data + Strike Teams = UA & Live-Ops Power

Tencent embeds data, production & tooling teams directly inside acquired studios.

This is the new competitive edge. Really!

**Mobile Equivalents:**

• Shared UA playbooks, Creative pipelines, Data science, LiveOps calendars & Cross-team economy discipline

*This is how top 100 grossing games stay top 100.*

#### 4. Focus Beats Variety

Tencent forces studios to drop side projects and double down on the strongest bet.  
Mobile needs the same discipline.

*One strong title with killer onboarding + LiveOps + UA flywheel will outperform five “maybe” games.*

#### 5. Cross-Studio Content Pipelines Are the Sleeper Advantage

Tencent accelerated Warframe’s seasonal cadence by pairing two studios inside its portfolio.

*Mobile Takeaway:*

• level design  
• LiveOps events  
• narrative packs  
• meta features  
could all be modular, shared, and accelerated across a studio group.

*Whoever masters content velocity wins mobile.*

#### 6. The Real Signal for Mobile Studios

Tencent’s global strategy isn’t about PC vs mobile.  
It’s about a new operating system for games:

• evergreen design  
• IP-first thinking  
• central data, tools, and LiveOps  
• ruthless focus  
• faster update pipelines  
• global publishing alignment

*This is the same OS that mobile will adopt at scale.*
