Just analyzed what keeps users coming back.  
  
𝟭. The Rule of Fun 🎮  
• Your core loop must be inherently fun  
• Strong mechanics enhance the experience  
• Don’t rely on story to fix boring gameplay  
• Prioritize core fun over monetization tactics  
  
𝟮. The Rule of Progression 📈  
• Create layered goals for every session  
• Ensure players always feel they are advancing  
• Balance minute-to-minute wins with long-term aims  
• Guide them from level completion to endgame mastery  
  
𝟯. The Rule of Variety 🔀  
• Repetition kills engagement quickly  
• Introduce new mechanics and modes over time  
• Don’t let the loop become stagnant  
• Surprise players with new bosses and challenges  
  
𝟰. The Rule of Challenge 🔥  
• Start easy to hook new players immediately  
• Scale difficulty to keep veterans engaged  
• Avoid static or strictly linear progression  
• Create a “wave-like” flow of tension and relief  
  
𝟱. The Rule of Connection 🤝  
• Games are simply better with friends  
• Shared experiences become the reason to return  
• Connect players via clans, trade, or competition  
• Turn solo players into active community members
