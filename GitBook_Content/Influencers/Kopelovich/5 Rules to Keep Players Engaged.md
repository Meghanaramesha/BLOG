Just analyzed what keeps users coming back.  
  
ðŸ­. The Rule of Fun ðŸŽ®  
â€¢ Your core loop must be inherently fun  
â€¢ Strong mechanics enhance the experience  
â€¢ Donâ€™t rely on story to fix boring gameplay  
â€¢ Prioritize core fun over monetization tactics  
  
ðŸ®. The Rule of Progression ðŸ“ˆ  
â€¢ Create layered goals for every session  
â€¢ Ensure players always feel they are advancing  
â€¢ Balance minute-to-minute wins with long-term aims  
â€¢ Guide them from level completion to endgame mastery  
  
ðŸ¯. The Rule of Variety ðŸ”€  
â€¢ Repetition kills engagement quickly  
â€¢ Introduce new mechanics and modes over time  
â€¢ Donâ€™t let the loop become stagnant  
â€¢ Surprise players with new bosses and challenges  
  
ðŸ°. The Rule of Challenge ðŸ”¥  
â€¢ Start easy to hook new players immediately  
â€¢ Scale difficulty to keep veterans engaged  
â€¢ Avoid static or strictly linear progression  
â€¢ Create a â€œwave-likeâ€ flow of tension and relief  
  
ðŸ±. The Rule of Connection ðŸ¤  
â€¢ Games are simply better with friends  
â€¢ Shared experiences become the reason to return  
â€¢ Connect players via clans, trade, or competition  
â€¢ Turn solo players into active community members
