I watched November’s #1 AppLovin ad frame by frame.Installed the game twice by accident.Not even mad. Taking notes. SuperPlay did the one thing we’re all desperately trying to crack:a complex standalone playable that tops the charts.It’s built on three psychological triggers:🔗 Manufactured CommitmentYou spawned on the saga map.Your brain treats this like progress you made.The next tap is free. So is the one after that.💥 Maximum Dopamine Per TapOne tap. Confetti everywhere.The game isn’t impressed with you.It’s just very, very enthusiastic about keeping you here.💍The 90% TrapRats run faster as they approach food.Nobody abandons a punch card at 9/10.Players will download an entire game to open a box.The best playables don’t promise a reward.They make you protect the progress you never made.Source: AppMagic
