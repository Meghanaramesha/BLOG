💡 Spotted in MONOPOLY GO! by Scopely On the building screen, MONOPOLY GO! uses a simple but super effective nudge to keep players progressing.Right above the landmarks, there’s a small reward icon paired with a countdown timer that reminds players they can unlock bonus rewards by finishing the board.It doesn’t interrupt gameplay, doesn’t pop up in the player’s face — just quietly sits there, pulling attention back to the upgrade loop.Why I like it:✅ Gentle nudge that keeps progression top-of-mind✅ Uses time pressure without feeling aggressive✅ Helps move players toward board completion and event rewardsA tiny detail, but a great example of how subtle prompts can drive consistent engagement.
