[Genesis Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/genesis-technology-partners/)‘s portfolio of Apps is doing $35 Mil. 🤑 a month in revenue and hardly nobody know who they are 😅. So what are we talking about in this episode?

This is an non-gaming app publisher holding company that is co-founding startups and giving them its expertise in marketing, analytics and user acquisition, so product people can focus solely on their product. Sounds familiar? Yes, this is exactly the model of big Hyper-casual publishers such as [Voodoo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/voodoo.io/), [SayGames](https://www.linkedin.com/company/saygames/) or [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/). Because you aggregate all the learnings 💡 within the holding company, it can then easily redistribute them among its new entrants into the portfolio, giving them a head start in the market. This is not working anymore within the game industry as all the giants shifted towards Hybrid Casual, but it seems the Apps market is having a great success with this model.   
  
So what are some of the example apps that we are talking about? Headway for instance is giving short book 📚 summaries with both text and audio version, promoting the idea of microlearning. It makes $1,6 Mil. a month just from mobile. It needs to be noted that there is a significant chunk of revenue also coming from the web that we don’t see. Next one is Better Me, a wellness app for both training 🏋 and food, $2,4 Mil. a month. Then there is PlantIn, a plant 🌵 care app, with plant identifier, another $2,6 Mil. a month. The list goes on and on. So, what do these have in common?   
  
Monetization 💸 model. All are using subscriptions of various degrees, with additional programs, price tiers and feature unlocks. This gives them a treasure throve of data that can be then optimized based on user funnels, offer segmentations, feature pacing etc. My guess is that there is a template, as it always should be within multiple app portfolios, which just gains strength with every learning and when a new app joins, they use the same “metagame” and just change the “core gameplay” of reading summaries, watering plants, cleaning phone files, etc. All can be be put on the same overall monetization structure. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎.
