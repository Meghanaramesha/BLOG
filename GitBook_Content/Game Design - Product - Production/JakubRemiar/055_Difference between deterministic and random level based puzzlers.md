Warning ☢️ Heavy Game Design post ahead. Do you know the difference between deterministic and random level based puzzlers? 🤔

In the current market we see more and more successful puzzle games following a completely different level design paradigm than your usual Candy Crush or Royal Match 👑. Puzzlers with their dominating sub-genres such as Match3 or Blast were always the masters of randomness, where difficulty was created using random or semi-random algorithms. You still need to do the level objectives, which are fixed, such as clearing certain items or collecting something from a generator, but the “candies” or tokens that you get to match varies with each playthrough. This randomness introduces a layer of chance, where even a well-planned strategy can be “sabotaged” by an unlucky arrangement or boosted by a fortunate 🍀 cascade of matches.   
  
Deterministic level-based puzzlers like Color Block Jam or Screwdom 3D have levels that have a specific, pre-designed solution. Every player who plays a particular level faces the same challenge and must figure out the exact same solution to the level. You basically “get better” at the level itself, with each subsequent attempt, until you eventually figure out the solution 💡. Failure is expected, but with each failure, you usually get closer and closer to the solution.  
  
Deterministic puzzlers require analytical thinking and a trial-and-error approach while random puzzlers reward adaptability and persistence. Players are encouraged to keep trying until luck and skill aligns. Obviously because the random category is currently heavily saturated on the market I am expecting more and more deterministic puzzlers with unique gameplay to enter the market following the giant success of games like Color Block Jam or Screwdom 3D 😁. Its not only a question of different gameplay feel but also different UA strategies, as these games resembles “hyper casual” visuals, which greatly helps their marketing setup.
