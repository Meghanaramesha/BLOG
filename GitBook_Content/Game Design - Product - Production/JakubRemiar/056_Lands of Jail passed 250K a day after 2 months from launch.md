Lands of Jail already passed $250K 🤑 a day in revenue after 2 months from launch. What is this prison themed game about ??? 🤔

The game is clearly following a [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/) 4X template of Idle Core first and then 4X map later. You start the game as jail warden, which later operates a force labor toy factory in the jail itself 😅 – that is the idle part modeled after Frozen City. There are some “flavor” mechanics added into the gameplay to spice it up, such as jail rebellion, similarly how Kingshot added the occasional enemy units invasion. In the auto combat based level saga you are capturing prisoner “villains”, which you then collect in a sticker album style fashion, giving you boosts to your whole facility.   
  
Our narrator character gets captured around 1 hour mark (as always 🙄) and you need to safe her by basically following gameplay mechanics. From this point it becomes the classic 4X map ⚔️ power struggle. This is the first time we have seen a 3rd company use this template successfully, while not being either [RiverGame](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivergame/) or Century Games. It seems that the idle core onboarding that Frozen City established, produces the smoothest onboarding funnels in 4X and can be easily repurposed into different themes such as fantasy, zombie survival or prison theme in this case.  
  
As usual with 4X this is a clear play for CPI, by differentiating the game through the prison theme, which is primarily used in creatives, but also very well translated into the actual gameplay. You operate a prison, you fight with prison themed heroes, you collect famous fugitive prisoners, everyone’s city on a map is a “prison”, all your soldiers are different flavors of less or more armed prisoners. My guess is we will soon see either some insects or sports theme 4X 😁 soon what do you think?
