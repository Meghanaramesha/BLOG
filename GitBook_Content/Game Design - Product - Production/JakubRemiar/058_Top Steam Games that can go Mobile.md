###### Steam Scanner #1 📡 aka “Full Steam Ahead” 🚂 is a new podcast segment, where we look at latest Steam games, that could translate well into mobile soon. Similarly how we saw games like Supermarket Simulator. Come check 12 new games that we found 😎

▪️ Starting the list with Schedule I, which is the biggest game of Steam Q1 2025. This drug empire simulator could continue on the Supermarket trend, but with a much “different” twist 😅.   
  
▪️ R.E.P.O., being another Q1 success, continues the trend of coop scary games like Lethal Company.   
  
▪️ Staying in the first person view then we have FlyKnight, an old school RPG dungeon crawler, with interesting insect visuals. (ehm, CPI 😅).   
  
▪️ Nubby’s Number Factory could really elevate the plinko style genre, through rogue lite mechanics that work so well on mobile.   
  
▪️ “A game about digging a hole” ⛏️, again hits very close to supermarket simulator niche, again first person, I am expecting numerous mobile follow ups on this.   
  
▪️ Spilled! is literally created based on Gold & Goblins resource creatives, which should work very well from CPI perspective.   
  
▪️ Aviassembly 🛩️ is a plane constructing simulator with cargo moving progression that has very good reception.   
  
▪️ inZOI tried to reinvent the “Sims” formula, to questionable successes, but my guess is that we haven’t seen all from them.   
  
▪️ Haste translates the speed fantasy very well, kind of close to some good old hyper casual games, we could see a well executed iteration.   
  
▪️ Digseum 🏛️ is literally the digging “minigame” that is being used in a lot of casual games, therefore CPI problem should be smooth 😁.   
  
▪️ Magic Archery 🏹 takes a very interesting spin on upgrading idler.   
  
▪️ Webfishing 🎣 is an interesting social space with giant engagement, I don’t even know what to think about that much traction that they have.
