A neat example of offering multiple recovery paths when players run out of moves.  
  
The pop-up gives three clear options:  
1️⃣ Spend in-game currency  
2️⃣ Watch a rewarded video  
3️⃣ Purchase a premium pack  
  
I like how it layers progression options for different player types — from free to ad-supported to paid.  
  
It’s a simple design that keeps everyone in the game, no matter their spending style.
