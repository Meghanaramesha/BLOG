## Help your mobile game GROW!

I’m passionate about helping clients grow their mobile games through innovative user acquisition strategies and impactful marketing campaigns. With 8+ years of experience, I transitioned from social media to performance marketing in the mobile gaming sector. As the UA lead at Two Desperados, I shaped the UA department and mastered performance marketing for mobile games. Now, as Head of UA at GameBiz, I focus on building UA strategies and optimizing media sources for mobile publishers.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I’m an avid gamer and marketer. I watch eSports and stream FPS games like CS:GO and Valorant. During my leisure time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, playing tennis, listening to music, and going on motorcycle rides.

This is the best advice we’ve ever had. It cheered us up and gave us the confidence to continue. We consulted with UA managers from big companies like Voodoo, who suggested we abandon the game, but your insights convinced us otherwise. Despite having already discontinued six games, we truly believe in the potential of this concept and have some great ideas to improve it. The initial bad tests made us doubtful, which is why we sought your advice. Your guidance has been invaluable, and we hope to collaborate with you in the future.
