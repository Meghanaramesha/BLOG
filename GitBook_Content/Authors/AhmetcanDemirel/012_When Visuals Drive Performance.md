# When Visuals Drive Performance

What can you do to improve your game’s performance when another title comes out of nowhere and speeds past it on every chart? You could double down on LiveOps, compete on seasonal content, or push daily events to the max. But guess what? Your competitor can do exactly the same, and probably will. You could also try to optimize your game through different levers such as your level funnel, monetization hooks, or progression systems. They often move the needle, but only marginally.

Instead, the smarter move might be to **understand how your rival got better at the very thing you were the best at**. Analyze what made them click with the audience you once owned. And while doing so, use the opportunity to differentiate your game again by bringing something fresh to the table.

This has been *Triple Match 3D*’s quiet but deliberate strategy as of late. While not drawing much fanfare, the game has undergone a substantial visual revamp alongside a few clever features and offer design updates they have already released. The aim? Reassert its dominance in a genre it once defined.

**The Rise (and Shake-Up) of Match 3D**
---------------------------------------

The Match 3D subgenre didn’t always command the attention it does today. For a long time, it was a sleepy, ad-heavy category. Loop Games’ *Match 3D* (it wasn’t a subgenre back then) and *Match Tile 3D*, which were sold to AppLovin later, set the early standard, leaning heavily into ad monetization rather than IAP strategies. These games were light, bite-sized, and had minimal monetization depth.

That changed with the arrival of *Triple Match 3D*. Launched in 2022, it essentially proved that this puzzle mechanic wasn’t just an idle distraction. It could be the spine of a sustainable, IAP-driven economy. For a while, *Triple Match 3D* stood uncontested, showing that Match 3D was a great core mechanic to build a puzzle game around.

A brief look at the history of the Match 3D space.

But then Peak entered the picture. In late 2023, *Match Factory* launched, and it didn’t just perform well. It dominated. Much like *Triple Match 3D* did when it first launched, *Match Factory* redefined expectations. **It brought polish, charm, and an attention to detail that resonated with a wider audience**. And while *Triple Match 3D* didn’t exactly fall off a cliff, it became clear that Peak had elevated the genre’s ceiling.

Today, the Match 3D space feels like a high-stakes two-horse race. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for an upset. History already showed us that a fresh take can flip the board overnight. And I’m sure we will see new entrants in this space that will challenge the incumbents.

**Closing the Visual Gap**
--------------------------

As much as it is super interesting to discuss the past, present, and future of the Match 3D space, let’s get back to *Triple Match 3D*’s quiet visual overhaul. For a long stretch, *Triple Match 3D* didn’t look bad per se, but it didn’t look great either. Certainly, it didn’t feel like a Hypercasual game, but it also lacked the kind of tactile polish and aesthetic consistency you expect from top-tier puzzle games. Compared to *Match Factory*, its visual identity felt less inviting, a bit more mechanical, and just not as cohesive.

Of course, the game was never stagnant. It invested heavily in LiveOps. It had a decent variety of events, boosters, and offers. But none of that could quite make up for the fact that the moment-to-moment experience was weaker. And **in a game where the core loop is about matching items repeatedly, visual delight is a core mechanic**.

Game items before (left) and after (right) the visual overhaul. The second picture looks way prettier even at a single glance.

For the last couple of months, that changed. Gradually, the in-game items began to shift. Less “clunky 3D objects”, more “elegant puzzle items”. Their visual language started aligning not just with *Match Factory*, but with the broader expectations of modern puzzle players. Think shinier surfaces, more contrast, richer color palettes. It was a change that many players wouldn’t articulate, but would feel.

How the main menu and the level pop up looked like before (left) and after (right) the overhaul.

This wasn’t a one-off change targeting a single part of the game. While the updated item visuals were the most noticeable, the facelift extended across the entire UI. The main menu evolved from a static waiting room into a visually appealing progression hub. Even smaller elements like the Daily Gift screen and level menu were reimagined, shifting from dry, utilitarian layouts to playful, inviting prompts that encourage interaction. Taken individually, these updates might be hard to pinpoint. But together, they significantly elevate the overall feel of the game, making it look and play like a much more polished experience.

The strong correlation between the downloads and revenue for *Triple Match 3D* has strongly shifted in the beginning of March.

And the numbers suggest something is clicking. It is still a bit early to make a definite call, but it looks like the game’s revenue performance is rising despite the decreasing downloads. While *Triple Match 3D* may not be winning a new install war, it appears to be deriving more value from every new and retained player. And there haven’t been any massive structural updates or new systems to explain the shift. So what changed? Most likely, the thing that’s easiest to ignore and hardest to quantify: visual fidelity. *Triple Match 3D* began looking like the game it always wanted to be.

**Building On What Works While Catching Up**
--------------------------------------------

Importantly, *Triple Match 3D*’s visual revamp isn’t its only play. It’s borrowing from the best while giving it its own identity. One such example is their recent take on the “Super Light Ball”, [which we examined in more detail in a previous article,](https://www.gamigion.com/the-sweet-art-of-feature-adaptation/) inspired by *Royal Match*. This wasn’t just a copy-paste job. *Triple Match 3D* found a way to implement it in a way that fits its physical-match gameplay and visual style. It feels native, not tacked on.

Meteor Strike in action, which I expect to be adapted by *Match Factory* soon.

Then there’s the “Mix & Match” offer, [which was also part of another previous article](https://www.gamigion.com/the-importance-of-personalization-in-gaming/). This is a standout monetization twist that goes well beyond industry-standard bundles. Instead of serving up rigid offers, this feature lets players create customized bundles from a curated selection of in-game items. What sets this offer apart is that players can truly mix and match every component. Something rarely seen in similar bundles.

The lesson here? You can play catch-up and still innovate. It’s not about being first to implement. It’s about doing it in a way that’s tailored, thoughtful, and context-aware. *Triple Match 3D* is trying to iterate its way back into relevance, not just through visuals, but by continuing to evolve its feature set.

**Will It Be Enough?**
----------------------

It’s genuinely impressive to see a game like *Triple Match 3D* refuse to fade quietly into the background. After being outperformed so decisively by *Match Factory*, many titles would settle into maintenance mode. Instead, *Triple Match 3D* is fighting to reclaim relevance. Not through flashy pivots, but through meaningful, systemic change.

And that matters. These visual and UX upgrades aren’t just surface-level polish. For a game operating with fewer new installs, every retained player becomes even more critical. The improvements we’ve seen impact not just how the game looks, but how it feels, how it’s experienced, and ultimately how much value it can derive from its existing player base.

Will that be enough to take back the crown? Probably not. But clawing back even a portion of the revenue ceded to *Match Factory* should be seen as a win in itself. The real mistake was waiting so long to meet the market’s visual expectations. Leaving a window wide open not just for Peak, but potentially for a third competitor to rise.

That’s why the next moves are crucial. If *Triple Match 3D* can consistently stay aligned with industry standards while continuing to sprinkle in the smart, player-first features we’ve seen lately, they may not retake the top spot, but they could lock in a very solid second. And with the Match 3D space only growing in visibility and revenue potential, that’s not a bad seat to hold.
