[Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/)‘s Color Block Jam 🟥, continues to scale past $500K in IAP 🤑 revenue only and 200K downloads a day. What new features have they added recently to continue this monster growth? 🕵

The team is adding a standard “level based puzzler” systems such as:   
◾ 2 Pre-level boosters (Time + Rocket)   
◾ 1 new booster during gameplay (Rocket from previous step)   
◾ 5 steps streak mechanic, which ties this all together giving you those 2 boosters as you win in a row  
  
As the new king of Hybrid-casual puzzlers, even Color Block Jam is no exception to its continuous evolution towards going full casual. These latest features that they added are a clear sign of that direction. As the game is currently more and more driven by IAP 💸 revenue instead of Ad revenue, this ratio will now get even more stronger towards the IAP share.   
  
The deterministic puzzlers (those whos levels stay the same even after a restart) are the new hot puzzle category right now with Color Block Jam doing $14 Mil. a month and Screwdom by [iKame Global](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ikame-global/) doing $9 Mil. a month, both in only IAP revenue, so there is some solid Ad revenue 📺 on top of this. I think that by the end of the year we will see the full Royal Match Meta combo treatment introduced to both of them, meaning more robust trigger events metagame, similarly how Match Factory has implemented it and a sticker collectible album. We will definitely keep both games on our radar on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎.
