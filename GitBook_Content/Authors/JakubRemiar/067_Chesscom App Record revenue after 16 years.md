##### [Chess.com](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chess-com/)‘s Chess app scaled to $200K a day

Its record revenue after unbelievable 16 years in the mobile stores. How is this possible? 😱

This is an all you can eat buffet for everything Chess. The feature set is super robust from around 10 different modification of main chess gameplay such as blitz, ranked, limited time from 3 minutes to 14 days a move ⏲️ to single player content of puzzles to solve in level based fashion and of course a chess coach with fully fledge coaching lessons. The best part about this app is that it takes great focus on analysis of your previous matches, training you and giving you real advice. In the end you will really be better at chess, not just play a game.   
  
The most unbelievable part is that there is NO UA. Yes, you heard it right. This app is so powerful that by the combination of external factors (such as Netflix’s Queen’s Gambit show) and clever use of additional features such as adding a Cat bot 😸 named Mittens it really created a perfect storm for growth. It also has a section with calendar of all major chess events and direct links to popular twitch streamers playing chess. We also can’t omit the fact that current top chess player in the world, Magnus Carlsen is very social media savvy and not only creates a lot of buzz around the sport and himself but also is directly connected to this app.   
  
The numbers are staggering. The app has 8 Mil. DAU and that is only counting mobile, not the web version, which is pretty much the same feature set. There are ads, but they are very minimal, so the whole revenue we see here is done by subscription. Just by adding a little bit of more ads, they could be earning significantly more on that giant player base, but again the question would be if it is worth it for the long run as they are still scaling higher. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/). I also won a game directly on the podcast 😜.
