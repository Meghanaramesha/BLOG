###### [ABI Game Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/abi-games-pte-ltd/)‘s Dreamy Room already scaled to $100K 🤑 a day revenue, mainly through ads. This is a super unique deterministic puzzler that we haven’t seen before or have we 😎?

This is actually another case of translating a popular Steam game with 30K positive reviews, in this case, “Unpacking” by Witch Beam, into a mobile hit. (Thanks for pointing out Mathieu 👍) In this case, the Steam game was released in 2021, so it’s not a recent hit follow up, but rather a careful iteration, as except for the proven core gameplay, a lot of mechanics needed to be adjusted to convert a premium game into a F2P viral hit. We will be doing a regular Steam segment soon, that will focus on predicting these trends so stay tuned 😁.   
  
The game itself works on levels as rooms, where you click on the box 📦, which spews out items that you need then to put into their correct place in the room. You don’t have any hints regarding their position, except the alignment of some obvious items like windows, but its mostly trial and error. Fail state is based on time and translates very well, as not being able to put in that last item, you will think twice about doing it again or using a booster 😅. Deterministic puzzlers really push you towards this chore-based monetization of “do you want to do it all over again for 4 minutes and maybe still fail at the end?” 😈   
  
This game is another hit coming from Vietnam, which just shows how strong the ecosystem is there as this is not “another copy” of a game that was seen in the charts last few months before. There was already iteration of the steam game by [SayGames](https://www.linkedin.com/company/saygames/)‘s Decor Life and Life Dream, but none of those hit the scale that the ABI’s hit is currently doing. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎.
