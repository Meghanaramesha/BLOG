Warning ☢️ Heavy Game Design post ahead. Are you capturing the spend depth of your live-ops events to its maximum? Here is a “little trick” 😎

Did you know that after you complete Royal Match’s card collection album, it actually unlocks another Grand collection album? 😮 Your collection will reset and all previous cards will be lost. You will then have to 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐬 for the remaining time of the original 2 months event! 😱 for better prizes of course. You see the top prize is now 15K soft currency + 15×3 boosters instead of 10K + 10×3 and of course a more special version of the original exclusive cosmetic 🍁.   
  
So what is happening here? Its important to have even the opportunity of the spend depth to capture the potential LTV of your biggest spenders. I guess that 80% of the players never even complete the first normal collection, so they don’t even know about this feature as it is not obvious. But as we know that in Free to Play 80% 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐨𝐩 5-10% 𝐨𝐟 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫𝐬 💸, you still want to give them something to do even though they already completed the event midway through the timer. So why not just recycle everything and just scale the excel sheet balancing and give them even bigger incentives for their giant effort 🤝?   
  
This is a really efficient prize for performance design, which you don’t even need to advertise in the first place, so that normal players don’t feel overwhelmed that they would need to complete 2 collections. Only the top ones will see it. I am currently playing the new Wittle Defender Game from [Habby](https://www.linkedin.com/company/habbyfun/) and I just completed the Sword of Umbra event which has actually 5! 🤣 rounds, so you can complete it 5 times for the same top prize. Of course it is about rolling in the event gacha 😅. This is how you capture the possible massive LTV of your top spenders. If you don’t give them the possibility you won’t have it. Think about it when designing your next live-ops event 😎.
