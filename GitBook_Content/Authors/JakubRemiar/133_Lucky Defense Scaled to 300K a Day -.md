# Lucky Defense Scaled to $300K a Day -

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-223.png)

**Daily $300K – just from IAP! 🤑**

Launched on May 25th the game already did $20M+ revenue and 3,5M downloads.

This is the same company that did Random Dice, the other very successful Tower defense game, which was later “westernized” into Rush Royale 😎.  
  
The main iteration of the game is in its core gameplay. It’s a Cooperative game instead of PvP ⚔ (even though you can play the PvP event). Instead of monsters getting into some kind of a portal, where you lose lives, they just circle the map.

The loose condition is based on the number of these monsters on the whole map, if it crosses 105 you lose the game. The random merging mechanic now continues into Mythic unit recipes, which are the main Damage units of the game + there is a gambling mechanic 🎰, where special currency can be gambled on more units like a slot machine.  
  
The gacha setup of this game is also “luck” on steroids as it amplifies both luck 🍀 and bad luck 😭. There are 2 rolls that the game makes, which one is the appearance of units (if they even spawn) and then another one if they pass into your castle (otherwise a guy with a bat flings them offscreen 😅).

If you pass a luck check, you can roll again for free. The problem is that Mythic units have a 1,8% appearance rate and on top of it only a 5% pass rate. This essentially means that nearly every single mythic unit that is walking towards your castle gets bated off the screen 😱 .  
  
The game holds up to its name “lucky” as a lot of mechanics are completely chance-based, such as the Frog Prince 🐸 unit, in which you have a 25% chance to ascend to a divine being, otherwise, it just disappears. Or the ability to enchant a Batman’s bat, which, you guessed it, can break and return to level 0.

The game makes more than 80% of overall revenue in South Korea and you can feel it, as it is super hard to get into, I guess that the “Rush Royale” scenario will happen here again with a proper Western iteration. Join us as we talk about all of this with Matej 🦩 & Felix 😎.
