# Biggest Mobile Games by DAU?

###### Do you know which mobile games are the biggest by 𝐃𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐬? And I mean really big 👀 😁

[[Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAArnpK8BJQauPullIeKCtAxunX451Gme5_I) always jokes (or not?🤣) on our podcast that Block Blast has the biggest DAU of all mobile games (17 Mil.), but this isn’t event close to the the actual biggest games on the market. [Roblox](https://www.linkedin.com/company/roblox/) having 90 Mil. is of course the biggest, but realistically it is a game ecosystem platform rather than a specific game. Which leaves the throne to Garena Free Fire 👑. This battle royal phenomenon is currently celebrating its 8th anniversary. It had its peak DAU 150 Mil. 😱 in June 2021. Then we have Clash Royale, which despite its user size being around 10% bigger (45 Mil.) than Clash of Clans makes around 50% monthly revenue of what Clans does 🤔.   
  
So what pattern do we see from this chart? 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐏𝐯𝐏 ⚔️  being the best retention driver, with five of the top ten entrants focused on competitive multiplayer (Clash Royale, Free Fire, PUBG Mobile, Brawl Stars, Mobile Legends Bang Bang). These games succeed by balancing session intensity, meta progression, and high-skill ceiling, while keeping controls and UX accessible on a touch screen. Clans also being heavily PvP driven, but just through asynchronous combat.   
  
Interestingly, Subway Surfers and EA FC show the longevity of genre staples. One is a more than a decade old endless runner with zero PvP, still doing around 18 Mil. downloads a month for the last 11 years 😅 straight. And the other a globally recognized football sim with heavy licensing that did its record monthly revenue of $32 Mil. just last year, even though it was released in 2016 😲.
