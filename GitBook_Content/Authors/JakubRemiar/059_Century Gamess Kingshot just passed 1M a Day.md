# Century Games’s Kingshot just passed $1M a Day

Century Games’s Kingshot just passed $1 Mil. a day 🤑 in revenue in less than 3 months from launch, scaling downloads to 200K a day. Do you know on which game it based its onboarding? 🕵

There is a Steam PC game called Thronefall, by a tiny indie studio called Grizzly Games 🐻.

Released for $12,99 in October 2024, to a great player reception, currently having nearly 20K reviews with 96% positive rating. It sold around 600K units for $4.1 Mil. revenue. Currently it gets around 500 daily active players. Its a Tower Defense, where you control you King in order to build your base during the day, steer your forces and defend against enemies during the night. So what happened here???  
  
Because in the current 4X market, where the big players are all up to standard from product perspective, the only thing that matters now is the winning UA creatives. Century iterated the already proven user friendly onboarding of Thronefall and integrated it as a starting point into their 4X template (Idle core of Frozen City + 4X). As you have guessed, all of the UA creatives are based on Tower Defense gameplay, which is also incorporated into the game though the “invasion” ⚔️ events, where you need to defend your city. And here is the kicker 😱:   
  
It took Whiteout Survival nearly 6 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐬 to do $1Mil. rev per day, where as Kingshot achieved it just in less than 3 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐬. Even though Whiteout is doing currently around $4 Mil. a day, I think Kingshot has a good chance get to the same scale as it is basically faster better stronger version of their previous game. What do you think, will Kingshot be able to overtook Whiteout Survival in daily revenue? 🤔
