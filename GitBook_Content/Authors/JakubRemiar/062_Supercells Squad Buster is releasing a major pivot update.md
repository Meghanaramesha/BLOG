[Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/)‘s Squad Buster is releasing a major pivot update tomorrow, what is new and will it be enough to avoid getting busted? 😅

▪️ Heroes introduced as the new paradigm for the game. They act as the holder of your other squad units that are fusing, now called “squaddies”  
  
▪️ 4 New heroes added – Archer Queen, Barbarian King, Mortis, Royale King  
  
▪️ Heroes have their own powers that you need to aim, passive traits, and their own turbo boost  
  
▪️ You still need to level up squaddies in the meta. You also choose 2 at the start of the match.  
  
▪️ Squaddies fuse together if you have 2 instead of 3 as before.  
  
▪️ As they fuse, Squaddies unlock powers for your heroes during gameplay  
  
▪️ Heroes and squaddies have factions, which produce synergies.  
  
▪️ You still attack even if you 𝐌𝐎𝐕𝐄!!!  
  
▪️ If your hero loses all of its health whole squad gets 𝐁𝐔𝐒𝐓𝐄𝐃 !!!  
  
So essentially Squad Busters is turning into much more complex version of Brawl Starts? 😅 As the possible combinations of Heroes and Squaddies abilities are quite big.   
  
As we were saying on our review on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast, readability was one of the main problems of the game. Now that you will see your hero HP and especially enemy hero HP during fight, you can easily evaluate who is winning, which is great fix.   
  
And also no more frustrating chases of those last remaining units spamming turbo. Hopefully PvP will be now a viable way to win, instead of only gem farming behind the scenes, which was the best strategy to win before. We can’t wait to do a review of the new update on the pod 😎.
