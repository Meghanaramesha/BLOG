🚧 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀  
1. Concept – find the gap  
2. Grey-box prototype – prove the loop  
3. Pre-production – art, tech, monetisation  
4. Production – full build + early tests  
5. Soft launch – limited regions, KPI focus  
6. Global launch – scale up  
7. Live service – events, updates, upkeep

• Market research – genre trends, rival moves  
• Influencers & PR – earned eyeballs  
• Brand positioning – one clear voice

📐 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 & 𝗯𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴

• Crash logs for live fixes  
  
Build, measure, learn, repeat until players can’t put the game down.
